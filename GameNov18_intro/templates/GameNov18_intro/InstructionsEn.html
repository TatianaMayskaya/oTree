            First, every participant will be randomly paired with another participant.
            In other words, you will have a counterpart, but you will not be told who it is.
            Your identity will also remain hidden from your counterpart.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two participants in a pair will have two different roles:
            <strong>player 1</strong> and <strong>player 2</strong>.
            You will be assigned randomly to a role, and it will be displayed at the beginning of the experiment.
            Your role will remain constant during the whole experiment.
        </p>

        <p>
            The experiment consists of 3 games. Once again, your role will remain the same for all games.
            However, your counterpart will be chosen <strong>randomly</strong> for each game.
            Since the roles remain the same, your counterpart will be chosen
            among the participants who have the opposite role.
        </p>

        <p>
            In each game, the two of you will together receive {{ endowment }} tokens
            and you have to decide how to divide this amount. The difference in games is in the rules.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Game 1
        </h4>

        <p>
            Player 1 makes an offer to player 2. This offer specifies how to divide the {{ endowment }} tokens
            between the two players. More precisely, player 1 chooses an integer between 0 and {{ endowment }}.
            This integer defines the number of tokens player 1 offers to player 2:
            if player 1 chooses X tokens, she means to leave {{ endowment }} - X tokens to herself.
        </p>

        <p>
            While player 1 decides on the offer, player 2 should decide on the minimum offer he would accept.
            More precisely, player 2 chooses an integer Y.
            If player 1's offer X turns out to be equal or greater than Y, the offer is accepted.
            However, if Y>X, the offer is rejected.
        </p>

        <p>
            The payoff in this game is defined as follows. If player 1's offer is accepted by player 2,
            the players receive their payoffs according to this offer:
            player 1 gets {{ endowment }} - X tokens, player 2 gets X tokens.
            If player 1's offer is rejected by player 2 (that is, player 2 chose the number greater than the one player 1 offered),
            <strong>both players receive {{ payoff_if_rejected }}</strong> tokens.
        </p>

        <p>
            In short: Player 1 makes an offer to player 2.
            Player 2 can either accept the offer or reject it.
            If he rejects, both get {{ payoff_if_rejected }} tokens.
        </p>

        <p>
            When all participants in the experiment made their choices in game 1, game 2 starts.
            You will see your payoff from game 1 at the end of the experiment, that is, at the end of game 3.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Game 2
        </h4>

        <p>
            As in game 1, player 1 chooses how much to offer to player 2.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast to game 1, player 2 does not make any choice in game 2.
            Any offer player 1 made is <strong>accepted automatically</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The payoff in this game is defined according to player 1's offer:
            when payer 1 chooses X, player 1 gets {{ endowment }} - X tokens, player 2 gets X tokens.
        </p>

        <p>
            When all participant with player 1 role made their choices in game 2, game 3 starts.
            You will see your payoff from game 2 at the end of the experiment, that is, at the end of game 3.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Game 3
        </h4>

        <p>
            Player 2 has to choose which game to play, game 1 or game 2.
        </p>

        <p>
            If player 2 chose game 1, the next screen asks him to indicate the minimum offer Y he would accept
            from player 1.
        </p>

        <p>
            If player 2 chose game 2, player 1's offer is accepted automatically and therefore there is nothing else to choose.
        </p>

        <p>
            While player 2 decides on the game (and on acceptance decisions if game 1 is chosen),
            player 1 should decide how much to give to player 2 for each game.
            More precisely, she has to choose choose two integers: how much to offer to player 2 if he chose game 1 (X1)
            and how much to offer to player 2 if he chose game 2 (X2).
        </p>

        <p>
            The payoff in this game is defined as follows.
            If player 2 chose game 1 and player 1's first offer is accepted by player 2
            (that is, X1 is greater or equal to Y),
            the players receive their payoffs according to this offer:
            player 1 gets {{ endowment }} - X1 tokens, player 2 gets X1 tokens.
            If player 2 chose game 1 and player 1's first offer is rejected by player 2 (that is, X1 is less than Y),
            both players receive {{ payoff_if_rejected }} tokens. If player 2 chose game 2,
            the players receive their payoffs according to player 1's second offer:
            player 1 gets {{ endowment }} - X2 tokens, player 2 gets X2 tokens.
        </p>

        <p>
            When all participants in the experiment made their choices in game 3,
            you will see your payoff from all three games.
        </p>

                After reading the instructions, each of you receive a small quiz that checks your understanding of
                these instructions. You will be asked to answer all questions in the quiz. Then your answers will
                be checked, and all mistakes will be explained.
                Your payment does not depend how well you perform on this quiz. The only purpose of this quiz is
                to eliminate any confusion you might have about the experimental design.
