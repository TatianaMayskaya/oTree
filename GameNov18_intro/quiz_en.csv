1,"Is it possible that your role (player 1 / player 2) will be changed during the experiment?",3,Yes,No,I do not know,,,,2,"Your role remains the same throughout the whole experiment."
2,"How likely would you get the same partner in all three games?",3,Your partner is the same in all three games,Your partner is chosen randomly at the beginning of each game,I do not know,,,,2,"Most likely, you will get a new partner for each game."

How many tokens would you get in game 1?",0,,,,,,,80,"Player 1's offer is greater than the minimum offer player 2 would accept. Therefore, the payoffs are determined according to player 1's offer: player 1 gets 100-20=80 tokens, player 2 gets 20 tokens."
