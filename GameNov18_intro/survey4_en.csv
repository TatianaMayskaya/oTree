1,"Any amount player 1 offers to player 2 is doubled in size: if player 1 gives x tokens out of 100 tokens to player 2 and the offer is accepted, then player 2 gets 2*x tokens, while player 1 gets 100-x tokens."
2,"Any amount player 1 offers to player 2 is halved: if player 1 gives x tokens out of 100 tokens to player 2 and the offer is accepted, then player 2 gets x/2 tokens, while player 1 gets 100-x tokens."

4,"In game 3, when player 2 chooses game 1 player 1 gets 200 tokens to divide; when player 2 chooses game 2 player 1 gets 100 tokens to divide."
